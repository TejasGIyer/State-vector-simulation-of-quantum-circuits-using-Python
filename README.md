This repository is my submission for the screening task for the QOSF mentorship program.

## Task: State Vector Simulation of Quantum Circuits

Implementing a state vector simulator from scratch and demonstrating familiarity with quantum circuits.

1)Naive Simulation using Matrix Multiplication: [here](https://github.com/TejasGIyer/State-vector-simulation-of-quantum-circuits-using-Python/blob/main/QOSF%20Subtask-1.ipynb)

2)Advanced Simulation using Tensor Multiplication: [here](https://github.com/TejasGIyer/State-vector-simulation-of-quantum-circuits-using-Python/blob/main/QOSF%20Subtask-2.ipynb
